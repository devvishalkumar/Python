ðŸŸ¦ Python

Overview

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing. Its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks makes it versatile and ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.

Introduction

Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, allowing developers to write clean and maintainable code. It is platform-independent, runs on multiple operating systems, and has extensive community support. Pythonâ€™s syntax is easy to understand, making it one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. It integrates well with other languages and tools, and its libraries cover areas like web development (Django, Flask), data science (NumPy, Pandas), AI/ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and automation.
